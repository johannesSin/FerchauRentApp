# Ferchau Car rent App

This repository contains material for the given task to develop a App with a DB for a car renting app. I used a DB with 3 tables (user, cars, rent). 
For this reason I installed "XAMPP Control Panel v3.3.0" to start a local DB for testing my application.
Download Link:

When installed "XAMPP Control Panel v3.3.0" needs to be started. 
    => Apache   => Start
    => MySQL    => Start    => press "Admin"
the local DB starts and the used structure can be imported from the repository "mysql-carapp.sql". Now the system is ready to use. 

Run the Java application from the IDE and activate several commands wich are implemented. Uncomment for testing and see the results in the DB by actualizing them.

Functions which are implemented:

User 
- CRUD

Car
- CRUD
- Rent status

RentApp
- Number of rented cars
- Rented km for specific car (with id)

Display whole Car DB

Display whole User DB
